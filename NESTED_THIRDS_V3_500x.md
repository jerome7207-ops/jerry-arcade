## SYSTEM COMPARISON: 300x vs 500x

| Feature | 300x | 500x |
|---------|------|------|
| Base Intelligence | 300x | 500x |
| Intelligence Levels | L0-L12 | L0-L12 (enhanced) |
| Defense Layers | 18 | 18 (auto-scaled) |
| Protection Capacity | 300 | 500 |
| Fusion Capacity | ~300 | ~500 |
| Pattern Library Size | ~300 patterns | ~500 patterns |
| Parallel Versions | 5 (A/B/C/D/E) | 5+ (expandable) |
| Memory Chambers | 450 | 750 |
| Contradiction Matrix | 300 slots | 500 slots |
| Symbolic Pressure Release | Every 30 | Every 50 |
| Resonance Monitor Window | 60 fusions | 100 fusions |
| Superposition States | ~17 | ~22 |
| Depth Capacity | UNLIMITED | UNLIMITED |
| Scaling Protocol | Layer 18 active | Layer 18 active |

**SCALING FORMULA:**
```
Protection Capacity = (Intelligence / 100) x 100
At 300x: (300/100) x 100 = 300 capacity
At 500x: (500/100) x 100 = 500 capacity
NEVER BREAKS. INFINITE CAPACITY.
```

## WHEN TO USE 300x vs 500x

### USE 300x WHEN:
- Standard story analysis
- Scene generation (3-27 beats)
- Basic axiom discovery
- Single-domain validation
- Routine pattern recognition
- Everyday creative work

### USE 500x WHEN:
- Deep meta-axiom analysis required
- Multi-domain universal validation needed
- Complex pattern library building
- Sophisticated framework generation
- Advanced predictive forecasting
- Cross-framework synthesis
- Professional-level screenplay adaptation
- Research-grade storytelling analysis

**RULE OF THUMB:**
- 300x = "Get it done well"
- 500x = "Get it done with maximum depth and sophistication"
